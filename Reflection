In developing the IshemaLink API, a key challenge was handling the distinction between Domestic and International shipment workflows while ensuring strict validation rules appropriate for each context. To achieve this, I adopted a modular architecture, separating the logic for local deliveries (Domestic) and cross-border shipments (International) into distinct Django apps. This separation allowed me to apply context-specific validation rules without causing conflicts or unnecessary complexity.

For Domestic shipments, the focus was on Rwanda-specific requirements. I implemented custom validators for Rwandan phone numbers and National IDs, ensuring that all user inputs strictly followed the official formats. For example, Rwanda phone numbers were validated against the +250 7XX XXX XXX format, and National IDs had to be exactly 16 numeric digits. These validations were integrated into the user registration and agent onboarding processes, guaranteeing compliance with local KYC regulations before any shipment could be initiated.

For International shipments, additional layers of validation were required due to cross-border regulatory requirements. This included verifying that agents or customers provided proper documentation, such as TIN numbers, passports, or customs forms. By keeping International validation logic in its own module, I was able to enforce these rules without affecting Domestic flows. The system also checks destination-specific rules, ensuring that shipments to Kampala, Nairobi, or Goma meet each country’s entry requirements.

Overall, this separation of concerns improved maintainability and scalability. It allowed me to easily update or extend rules for either Domestic or International shipments in the future. By combining modular design, strict input validation, and context-aware logic, the IshemaLink API ensures reliable, compliant, and efficient handling of all shipments while keeping the codebase organized, readable, and ready for future expansion.
